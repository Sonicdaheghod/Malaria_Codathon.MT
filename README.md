# USF Codathon - Machine Learning

## Theoretical Project Workflow

* The goal of this project for the Codathon was to use the unsupervised machine learning algorithm Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify specific genotypes of malaria-infected patients from a public dataset.

## My role

* I was responsible for extracting the homozygous genotypes from the public dataset and organizing it into a pandas dataframe. The headers for the horizontal axis of the table is the chromosome name, position, and each of the samples' names. This data will then be used for PCA ran by my team members.

## Issues encountered

* Original dataset too large to process into code - had to break down into subsets to properly run
* My code was not concise or had unnecessary functions when it could be simplified

## Future endeavours

From the project, we hope to do the following-

* Apply the code to future datasets where isolating desired genotypes for PCA is required
* See how we can get the PCA to work on datasets of diseases since we used a practice dataset of wine samples in this project to practice using PCA.
